### **3. Tree**
- **Commands**:
  1. **`jaha`** (pwd)  
     - Functionality: Get the current directory path.  
     - Data Structure Usage: Traverse the `DirectoryTree` to construct the path from the root to the current node.  

  2. **`dikhao`** (ls)  
     - Functionality: List files and directories in the current folder.  
     - Data Structure Usage: Iterate over the children of the current directory node.

  3. **`chalo <path>`** (cd)  
     - Functionality: Change directory to a specific folder.  
     - Data Structure Usage: Traverse the `DirectoryTree` to update the current directory pointer.

  4. **`wapas`** (cd ..)  
     - Functionality: Navigate to the parent directory.  
     - Data Structure Usage: Use the `parent` pointer in the tree to move up one level.

  5. **`banaoDir <directory>`** (mkdir)  
     - Functionality: Create a new directory.  
     - Data Structure Usage: Add a new node to the `DirectoryTree` as a child of the current node.

  6. **`khojo <filename>`** (find)  
     - Functionality: Search for a file or directory.  
     - Data Structure Usage: Perform DFS or BFS traversal on the `DirectoryTree`.

---

### **4. Queue**
- **Commands**:
  1. **`kamDekho <filename>`** (head)  
     - Functionality: Display the first N lines of a file.  
     - Data Structure Usage: Enqueue lines as the file is read; dequeue and display the first N.

  2. **`antDekho <filename>`** (tail)  
     - Functionality: Display the last N lines of a file.  
     - Data Structure Usage: Maintain a fixed-size queue to hold the last N lines.

  1. **`wapas`** (cd .. with history)  
     - Functionality: Navigate up one directory and manage navigation history.  
     - Data Structure Usage: Push directories visited by `chalo` onto the stack; pop the stack for `wapas`.

---

### **6. Vector/Array**
- **Commands**:
  1. **`dikhao`** (ls)  
     - Functionality: Temporarily store the list of files and directories for iteration.  
     - Data Structure Usage: Store directory contents as a vector for easy traversal.

  2. **`pehchano`** (whoami)  
     - Functionality: Retrieve the logged-in user's name.

This organization ensures each command is implemented with the most suitable data structure for efficiency and clarity in your **Bhai Lang Terminal**!Hereâ€™s the **Bhai Lang commands** grouped by the **data structure** used in their implementation:

---

### **1. Linked List**
- **Commands**:
  1. **`itihas`** (history)  
     - Functionality: Stores and navigates through the history of executed commands.  
     - Data Structure Usage: Each command is a node in the linked list for sequential navigation.

---

### **2. Hash Table**
- **Commands**:
  1. **`banao <filename>`** (touch)  
     - Functionality: Create a file and store its metadata.  
     - Data Structure Usage: Store file metadata (size, timestamp, path) in the hash table.  

  2. **`jaane <filename>`** (file info/stat)  
     - Functionality: Fetch detailed file metadata.  
     - Data Structure Usage: Retrieve metadata from the hash table.

  3. **`mitao <filename>`** (rm)  
     - Functionality: Delete a file and remove its metadata.  
     - Data Structure Usage: Remove file metadata from the hash table.
